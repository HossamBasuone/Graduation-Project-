HealthHub is a modern healthcare web platform that allows doctors, hospitals, and even freelancers to offer their services online. Built with a clean and accessible UI, the platform is designed especially with older and less tech-savvy users in mind.

I built this front-end from scratch as part of a graduation project, focusing on secure user flows, responsive UI, and modular React architecture.
